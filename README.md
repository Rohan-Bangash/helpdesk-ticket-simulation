# helpdesk-ticket-simulation

This project simulates a real-world IT Helpdesk environment by documenting and resolving 10 common user support issues using a structured ticketing system.

## Objective

To demonstrate hands-on knowledge of IT support workflows, issue categorization, prioritization, and problem-solving through realistic helpdesk tickets â€” all managed in a professional format to reflect entry-level IT support duties.
